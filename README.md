When the program is first opened, if it is connected to the network, it automatically takes the IP and if it is not connected to the network, the server is started according to the port value entered via localhost.
When a client connects to the server, it is added to the list below and the client list is notified by transmission to other clients.
The server can transmit messages to one or more clients by selecting from the list.
Messages sent by clients among themselves can be displayed in the text block on the screen.
Messages sent between clients or by the server to clients are recorded in the chat.txt text file on the desktop, and filtering is done through this file.
